When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Mostly for sharing and collaborative work. I guess it can also be used as a backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Remote files may be added by others and are not ready to be included/merge into the local repository
