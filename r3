When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Mostly for sharing and collaborative work. I guess it can also be used as a backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Remote files may be added by others and are not ready to be included/merge into the local repository

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks is like making a clone of a repository on Github whereas clone is for making a copy of a remote repository onto a local machine. 
A branch is like a copy of a commit on the same local machine to allow a separate development
