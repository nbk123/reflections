What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It serves as a holding place to put all the versions?

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It offers a temporary area to hold files that we want to commit. This allows us to make many changes before making a commit.
